    <h1>A little about Shared Power.</h1>
    <p> Established in 2017.</p>
    <b>"</b><i> SharedPower is an information system to help tradesmen to share expensive and specialist tools rather than buying them themselves. Registered owners add details of the tools they have available including the per day and per half day rate for each unit. Other registered users can hire the tools. They can search and check the availability of a tool, up to 6 weeks in advance. If a tool is free it can booked for up to 3 days. Though tools are usually collected by the hiring user it is possible to arrange a dispatch rider to pick-up or drop off in urgent situations. Returning a tool late is fined at double the day rate for every day it is missing. Once per month of all users are calculated and accounts are settled. A flat charge of Â£5 is added to all bills for insurance. When tools are checked in or out, photos and notes on condition are uploaded to the system. If there is a serious issue of damage or cwear with a unit, then insurance company investigates, determines who is at fault and if necessary pays for the repair of the tool. When tools are being repaired they are unavailable. <b>"</b></i>
